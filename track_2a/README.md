# Academia Challenges

Submissions must use the Apertus model family.
For Track 2 this means that submitted solutions must be built with Apertus. Other open-weights models can be used to support development, e.g. as automatic judges during evaluation. Their role must be clearly described in the submission report.

## How it works
Pick from 5 academia challenges provided by Swiss academic institutions:

- **FHGR:** AI-Powered Job Interview Coach
- **OpenParlData:** Extracting Parliamentary Affairs from PDFs into One Common Structure
- **OST:** Multilingual Natural Language Inference over Swiss Official Voting Booklets
- **UZH:** Detecting Cross-Lingual Semantic Differences in Swiss Government Websites
- **ZHAW:** See It, Say It, Pick It: Vision-Language Grounding for a Real Robot Arm

The challenges incl. submission and judging criteria are described in our **Getting Started guide**:

## Run it

Keep `track_2a/` as it is: don't rename it or move its files, just delete the
other track directories.

From the root of the project:

```bash
make run
```

Fill in the [Makefile](Makefile) so that it works on a clean checkout. It is
expected to run the project in a Docker container, since that is how the judges
will run it, without relying on anything already installed on your machine.

Requirements: `runtime, hardware, API keys, model weights`

### Quickstart (FHGR Interview Coach)

Requirements: Docker with Compose v2, an Apertus API key (CSCS). No GPU or local weights needed.
Apertus runs on the [CSCS LLM inference API](https://docs.cscs.ch/services/inference/api/#llm-inference-api-service)
(`https://api.inference.cscs.ch/v1`, model `swiss-ai/Apertus-v1.5-8B`).

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # then fill in LLM_NAME, LLM_BASE_URL, LLM_API_KEY
make run                  # = docker compose up --build, serves on :8000
```

Check it:

```bash
curl localhost:8000/health
curl -X POST localhost:8000/chat -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"message": "Grüezi! Wer bist du?"}'
```

`/chat` returns `{"answer", "request_id", "llm_calls"}`. Without `.env` the service
still starts and `/health` works; `/chat` then returns 503.

Every LLM call is logged as one JSON line with `"event": "llm_call"`, and each answer
logs `"event": "answer"` with `calls_per_answer`:

```bash
docker compose logs backend | grep '"event": "answer"'
```

Interview loop:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8000/session -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"role": "Junior Data Analyst", "language": "de"}'          # -> session_id + first question
curl -X POST localhost:8000/session/<session_id>/answer -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"answer": "Ich habe Wirtschaftsinformatik studiert ..."}'  # -> analysis + next question
```

Each answer runs a LangGraph turn: one **analysis call** (6 criteria scored 1-5, JSON) and then one
**interviewer call** (follow-up question or the next phase). If the analysis JSON can't be used, the
analysis call is retried, up to 3 attempts in total. Retries count as LLM calls, so the worst case is 4 calls
per answer and the normal case is 2. Sessions are kept in memory and lost when the service restarts.

Code layout: `src/backend/main.py` (FastAPI), `src/backend/llm.py` (Apertus client + call counter),
`src/backend/interview/` (`graph.py` LangGraph loop, `parsing.py` robust JSON parsing, `prompts.py` criteria + phases).

Tests (Python 3.12): `pip install -r src/backend/requirements-dev.txt && pytest`
